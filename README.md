# Isomorphic from scratch

There are so many takes out there on how isomorphic apps should be done, that it is a bit overwhelming for a beginner.
Therefore, I am starting a ReactJS app from scratch with the goal of having a bare isomorphic app to use as a skeleton.
Besides having yet-another-starter-kit, I would like to take it step by step and understand the decisions I am making on the way, rather than getting everything as a given black box.
